## File Organization

- All HTML pages are located in the `/public` directory
- Static resources (CSS, JS, images) are organized in the `/assets` directory
- Shared components will be stored in the `/includes` directory
- All file paths are relative to maintain portability

## Development Notes

- All design elements (colors, fonts, spacing) remain unchanged
- Internal page links use relative paths
- Resource paths are updated to reflect the new structure
- JavaScript files are organized in `/assets/js`
- CSS files are organized in `/assets/css`
- Images and media files are stored in `/assets/images`
